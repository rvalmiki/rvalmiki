Details about the project. What did you do. how did you do and any other relevant info that would be necessary for evaluators to judge your work.

This project was created as part of the INSAID capstone to help HR Advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organization. The data was sources from the HRMS where the details of all past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
